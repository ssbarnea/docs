# Contact

If you want to send me and email try to find my email address in some git logs.

Most of the time you can find me on freenode irc channels, using `zbr` or ssbarnea nicknames. Common channels: `#oooq` `#ansible-molecule` `#ansible-devel` `#pycontribs`.

Other options a skype \(sbarneasorin\), whatsapp, telegram, imessage or facebook.
